DARE: Deception Analysis and Reasoning Engine

This repository contains the code for "Deception detection in videos", in AAAI 2018.

To run this code, you also need to download the extracted and encoded features from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W1DRmQXw3o7lqYLMD8LyNjXC4S09S38l/view?usp=sharing). These features should be moved to the project folder. The libsvm path also needs to be changed.

The video clips and additional annotation can be downloaded from this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/n2fk939xi08l5d3/Video_chunks.zip?dl=0).

Note: Our experiments evaluated the performance on 10-fold cross validation with respect to the people ID, not to the videos), as stated in the paper.
